# FinalPythonproject
Final project provided for Python class

This final project was made by Gabriel Martinica

To run the program, you need the necessary files: transactions.csv, categories.csv and customers.csv in the same folder as the program you are running.

The first thing the program asks you is the customer ID. If you want the program to work, you need to give it a valid customer ID. The customer ID list can be found in customers.csv. If you do not give it a valid customer ID, then you will have to try again. The same will be done for the product.

If you input a valid ID and product, the program will pop a message recommending a product for the customer. It will also create a text file which contains a sample email recommending another product for the customer so that you can copy and paste it to send it via Outlook, Gmail, etc.

If you want to convert directly from the Excel file again, for some reason, when you convert the Excel file to csv it does not have a carriage return at the end of the file so you just open the csv and at the last line and character, just hit enter and it should work fine. Nevertheless, you do not need to do this because the csv file is already given.

That's it! Enjoy the recommendations
